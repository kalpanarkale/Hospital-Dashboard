The React-based hospital dashboard is a comprehensive web application designed to provide an organized view of hospital-related information. It features:

### Components 
- Header: Displays the application title and navigation.
- Filters Bar: Allows users to filter and search through available data.
- Doctor Cards: Show detailed information about doctors, including their names, departments, and contact details.
- Appointments Table: Displays a list of scheduled appointments, including patient names, appointment dates, times, and assigned doctors.
